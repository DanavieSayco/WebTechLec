    <h1>Response Header Fields</h1>
    <p>Response header fields only appear on response messages sent by the server.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accept-Ranges
            <p>Accept-Ranges allows partial resources to be requested by the client. The header will have the value of ‘none’ if it does not allow clients to request partial resources. The server may opt not to send the header field at all if it is the case.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Age
            <p>Age displays how long ago the response has been generated. The value of this header field are non-negative decimal integers and specifies time in seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>ETag (Entity Tag)
            <p>ETag is a weak identifier and is used for conditional requests. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Location
            <p>Location is used for redirection. If present, the server will fetch the latest resource from the location specified in this header field. For responses with 201 status code, the value of the header field would be the location where the new resource generated by the request can be found. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Proxy-Authenticate
            <p>Proxy-Authenticate is a challenge imposed to the client to prove authorization to access the proxy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Retry-After
            <p>Retry-After is the amount of time the client has to wait before trying again. It can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response and with any 3xx (Redirection) response, though 3xx responses may opt not to include this header field. The value can be an HTTP-date or an integer number indicating time in seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Server
            <p>Server contains information about the server. When a proxy is used in delivering a response, a Via header field must be included in the header. It is advised to configure this header field since too much information about the server makes it susceptible to attacks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Vary
            <p>Vary is used for content negotiation. It specifies which request header field values can the client change for the server to deliver a different kind of content.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
