	<h1>HTTP Request URI</h1>
    <p>Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority<br />
	The Request URI, which URI means 'Uniform Resource Identifier', identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>*
			<p>The asterisk * form is used when an HTTP request does not apply to a particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource.</p>
		</li>

		<li>absoluteURI
			<p>The absoluteURI is used when an HTTP request is being made to a proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service from a valid cache, and return the response.</p>
		</li>

		<li>abs_path
			<p>The abs_path form is used to identify a resource on an origin server or gateway. This cannot be empty; if the original URI is empty, it MUST be given as "/" (the server root).</p>
		</li>
        
		<li>authority
			<p>The authority form is only used by the CONNECT method (method def. in <a href="http-request-methods.html">Request Methods - CONNECT</a>.)</p>
		</li>

	</ul>
